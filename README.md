# Deep-learning-practice
this repository records my practices in deep learning platforms: tensorflow, keras and mxnet.

## CNNs_tensorflow
I have implemented different CNN structures: alexnet inception resnet vggnet with tensorflow slim library.

you can see the stuctures in the CNNs_tensorflow folder.

## Keras_yolo
I have replemented yolo structures in Keras and visualized it.

## Lenet_tensorflow
Lenet is just like the "hello world" of deep learning. I have implemented it in tensorflow and trained with mnist dataset.

## Mxnet_leaf_classification
Mxnet is the main platform for Amazon. It is really good for multi-gpus training. I implemented the Resnet18 in mxnet to do leaf classification.
